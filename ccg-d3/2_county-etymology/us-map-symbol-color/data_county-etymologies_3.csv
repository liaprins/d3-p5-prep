The first is that the name was given by Nome’s founder, Jafet Lindeberg, an immigrant from Norway. Nome appears as a toponym in several places in Norway. A second theory is that Nome received its name through an error: allegedly when a British cartographer copied an ambiguous annotation made by a British officer on a nautical chart, while on a voyage up the Bering Strait. The officer had written “? Name” next to the unnamed cape. The mapmaker misread the annotation as “C. Nome”, or Cape Nome, and used that name on his own chart; the city in turn took its name from the cape. The third proposed origin of the name is from a misunderstanding of the local Inupiaq word for “Where at?”, Naami.
